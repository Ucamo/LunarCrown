Dots of War is an addictive and competitive puzzle game (based on dots and boxes / Timbiriche) in which you have to connect points with lines to gain ground against your opponent.
Choose one of the three clans available to compete online.

The objective is simple: Forming a square with four lines will capture the terrain, once you do it you will have an extra turn. You can use your ability to prevent your opponent from using combos!
